<b>PascalSECURE</b> is a securitysystem for the most popular standard controls of Lazarus

Brought to you by Fabio Luis Girardi and Andreas Frie√ü

<b>This is the stable repo.</b> If you are searching the development repo, take a look at https://github.com/afriess/pascalsecure/

Every securecontrol (Button, Edit, TabSheets,...) can activated/deactivated by free defined keys. You have to write only the logic depended on your need. Database, Textfiles, API,... all is possible.

These components allows you easy implement a security system on your application, GUI or console.
The basic usage of these components are:
  1) Insert a Security Manager. Choose one model (user level, user and authorizations, user/groups with authorizations...) that best fits on your needs, or write your own model using a customizable model.
  2) Insert a Security Interface (graphical, console or customized Login/UserManagement).
  3) If you are developing a GUI application, insert secure controls and set the property SecurityCode.

It is a standalone part of PascalSCADA 1.0 - A multiplatform SCADA framework for Lazarus. This code is a entire rewrite of PascalSCADA hosted at https://sourceforge.net/projects/pascalscada. The main goal of this initiative is:

Make security easy for normal applications
Extend the security system to all standard controls of Lazarus
Improve the translation, using .PO files instead of language defines
Improve the project modularization
